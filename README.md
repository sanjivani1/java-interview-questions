### Exercises

#### Find the longest substring(s) that doesn't contains any letter duplicates from a string

Input examples: `"abcsadjnii"`

#### The solitary integer (Simple)

Given a list of integers `LIST = [1,4,3,3,2,5,1,2,5,7,7, ...]` with size `N`.

We know `LIST` contains only duplicated numbers (numbers that appear twice) except ONE integer which is called *The Solitary Integer*.

Write an efficient algorithm that will determine this integer ?

Can you solve the exercise in O(N) ?

#### Pangrams (Simple)

Roy wanted to increase his typing speed for programming contests. So, his friend advised him to type the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" repeatedly, because it is a pangram. (Pangrams are sentences constructed by using every letter of the alphabet at least once.)
After typing the sentence several times, Roy became bored with it. So he started to look for other pangrams.
Given a sentence s, tell Roy if it is a pangram or not.

**Input Format**
Input consists o a string s.
Example:
```
We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize
```

**Output Format**
Output a line containing “pangram” if s is pangram, otherwise print “not pangram”.
Example:
```
pangram
```

#### Balanced Parentheses (Medium)

Given a sequence consisting of parentheses, determine whether the expression is balanced.
A sequence of parentheses is balanced if every open parentheses can be paired uniquely with a closed parentheses that occurs after the former. Also, the interval between them must be balanced. You will be given three types of parentheses: (, {, and [.


```
{[()]} - This is a balanced parentheses.
{[(])} - This is not a balanced parentheses.
```

Example:

**Input**
```
3
{[()]}
{[(])}
{{[[(())]]}}
```

**Ouput**
```
YES
NO
YES
```
